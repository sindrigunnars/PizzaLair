This is the project PizzaLair for the VLN-2 course. The program is intended to
handle pizza ordering and management of these orders, the basics of an online store.

For this project you need to set up a virtual environment and import the packages from
the requirements.txt file included within the project directory. Then you need to run the
statement 'python manage.py runserver 8000 --insecure' from the verklegt-2 directory.

NOTE: This project has debug mode off, although we did not make any error screens, our error where
handled in a way that when users do something wrong the website redirects them away, f.x. when an 
anonymous user tries to add to cart or view cart.

Some extra requirements we implemented are an auto logout when user is idle for 10 minutes and a footer
that includes information on our business.
